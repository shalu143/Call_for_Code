# Call_for_Code
In the Call for Code Global Challenge, you can join the fight against climate change by building and deploying open source solutions in the cloud. By participating, youâ€™ll build critical skills for yourself and your teams and deploy solutions to help communities across the globe.  Built on open source principles, the Call for Code Global Challenge asks developers and problem solvers to form teams and develop solutions that address specific problems in unique, clearly demonstrable ways. The most successful solutions are those scoped to have the greatest community impact with the smallest technological footprint.
