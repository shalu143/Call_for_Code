# Prakriti
Prakriti is a local marketplace app that doles out relevant information
empowering consumers to take data-backed decisions.... in a fun way!

In a gamified approach, users are rewarded based on their product purchases. We have created a tool
that reads purchase bills through OCR and outputs a score based on products bought. We took a data-
driven universal metric â€“ the ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) score - which
measures a company's relative ESG performance, commitment and effectiveness based on publicly-
reported data. We then combine the ESG score with IBM Watson enabled 'sentiment score', that
measures a company's exposure to environmental, social and governance controversies and negative
events reflected in global media by scanning over 25 million media and data sources.
