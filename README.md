## Short Description
### What's the Problem
The looming threat of climate change has made responsible consumption is the need of the hour we need to spark collective action on a mass-scale to protect our planet. Multiple surveys over the past few years show that an increasing percentage of the population wants to buy purpose-driven brands. However green or conscious consumerism is easier said than done. It involves making drastic behavioral shifts - making the right choices in this age of information influx. To enable this, we need to make conscious consumerism more realistic and the decision-making process easier by making the relevant information easily accessible.
### How Technology can help
Consumers need to start including sustainability as the criteria for buying a product, in addition
to price, quantity, brand, etc. But there is a need to easily access an objective metric that can quantify sustainability - like the universal metric, the ESG score (environmental, social, and corporate governance), which measures a company's relative ESG performance, commitment and effectiveness based on publicly reported data. There must also be a way to capture sustainability effects based on recent and updated findings - IBM Watson enabled 'sentiment score' measures a company's exposure to environmental, social and governance controversies
and negative events reflected in global media by scanning over 25 million media and data sources. Conscious buying can also be made into a practice by using a gamified  approach to incentivize conscious choices and a platform that fosters sense of community helps to not only make these habits but also effectively keep them
### The Idea
Prakriti is an app that makes conscious consumerism accessible to all consumers wherever they may be in their eco-friendly journey. The first feature is instant access to metrics that measures any brand's eco-friendly quotient (ESG score + IBM Watson sentiment score) in a gamified manner so that good choices are incentivized through 'green points'. It also has a marketplace for those willing to take an extra step by discovering local and recycled products near them. And the final feature is a community page for the seasoned eco-conscious consumer to share their wisdom and help others in the transition towards conscious consumerism.
