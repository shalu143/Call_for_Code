## Prakriti
Climate change that was once a distant possibility has now found its way into normal parlance.
Its effects are alarming, with temperatures soaring, water levels depleting, all ultimately
resulting in loss of life. Responsible consumption is the need of the hour and we need to spark
collective action on a mass-scale to protect our Mother Earth. Multiple surveys over the past
few years show that an increasing percentage of the population wants to buy purpose-driven
brands. However green or conscious consumerism is easier said than done. It involves making
drastic behavioral shifts, making the right choices in this age of information influx. To enable
this, we need to make conscious consumerism more realistic and the decision-making process
easier by making the relevant information easily accessible.
In India, sustainable living is an uphill task. Companies offering eco-conscious products are
bootstrapped, scattered and their voices lost in the din of larger companies.
Here comes the solution- "Prakriti": a local marketplace app that doles out relevant
information empowering consumers to take data-backed decisions... in a fun way!

In a gamified approach, users are rewarded based on their product purchases. We have created a tool
that reads purchase bills through OCR and outputs a score based on products bought. We took a data-
driven universal metric â€“ the ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) score - which
measures a company's relative ESG performance, commitment and effectiveness based on publicly-
reported data. We then combine the ESG score with IBM Watson enabled 'sentiment score', that
measures a company's exposure to environmental, social and governance controversies and negative
events reflected in global media by scanning over 25 million media and data sources.
The users are then rewarded in terms of green points for their purchases. A leaderboard keeps track of community scores with special benefits accrued to the more eco-conscious users. A Marketplace feature
will enhance the visibility of local companies, enabling easier discovery. These would be rigorously
vetted to ensure they are indeed eco-conscious. A wholesome set of options from purchasing, renting,
recycling and reselling would be available to the consumer to choose from, covering the entire product
lifecycle. Community listing would also be enabled to promote sharing and reducing wastage.
Finally, a community forum to discuss burning issues, conduct events like plantation drives etc. would be
provided. For, without support from community habits are hard to sustain.

With Prakriti, we make conscious consumerism accessible to all consumers wherever they may be in
their eco-friendly journey - by providing metrics related to the environment a gamified manner to
make decision making easier for those just starting out in making a change. A marketplace for those
willing to take an extra step by discovering local and recycled products near them. And finally, a
community page for the seasoned eco conscious consumer to share their wisdom and help others in the
transition towards conscious consumerism. Because, more than a few people doing a lot for the
environment, what we need is a lot of people doing the little they can!
